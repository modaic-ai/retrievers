title: Packaging an Agent
description: How to package an agent for sharing on Modaic Hub

You can allow others to resuse the frameworks you built with `push_to_hub(with_code=True)`. This will package the agent and all its dependencies into a single folder that can be loaded dynamically.

# Structuring Your Workspace
If you haven't already, install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/). You can use `uv init` to create a new workspace. 
If your workspace is already setup, thats also fine just make sure to include a `pyproject.toml` and a `README.md`.
Your workspace must be strucured in one of the following ways:
1. A single python file with no internal imports.
```
my_agent/
├── __init__.py
├── agent.py # Contains your agent class and config class (does not need to be named agent.py)
├── README.md # (recommended) used to make your agent card
└── pyproject.toml # Necessary for bundling
```
2. A subfolder containing an `__init__.py` (can be empty), your agent definition, and all supporting code. 
```
my_agent/
├── __init__.py
├── agent/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── agent.py # Contains your agent class and config class (does not need to be named agent.py)
│   ├── some_other_module1.py # Contains supporting code imported by agent.py
│   └── some_other_module2.py # Contains supporting code imported by agent.py
├── README.md # (recommended) used to make your agent card
└── pyproject.toml # Necessary for bundling
```
