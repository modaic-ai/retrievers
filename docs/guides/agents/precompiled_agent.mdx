title: "PrecompiledAgent"
---

The `PrecompiledAgent` class is the bread and butter of Modaic. It is the home of your agent's logic. You can think of it like the `PretrainedModel` class in huggingface's `transformers` library. `PrecompiledAgent` is a subclass of `dspy.Module` from the [dspy](https://dspy.ai/) library. So anything you can define with a `dspy.Module` you can define with a `PrecompiledAgent`. What `PrecompiledAgent` adds to `dspy.Module` is a direct integration to Modaic's context engineering, observability, and version control stack.

# Quick Start

```python
from modaic import PrecompiledAgent, PrecompiledConfig
import dspy

# define a config class to store experiment specific parameters
class WeatherConfig(PrecompiledConfig):
    weather: str = "sunny"

class WeatherAgent(PrecompiledAgent):
    config: WeatherConfig # !! This is super important to link the agent to the config!!
    def __init__(self, config: WeatherConfig, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(config, **kwargs) # !! This is super important you must pass the config in as an argument to super().__init__(), also must forward kwargs to super().__init__()
        self.summarize = dspy.ReAct(signature="question->answer", tools=[self.get_weather])

    def forward(self, query: str) -> dspy.Prediction:
        return self.summarize(query=query)

    def get_weather(self, city: str) -> str:
        """
        Get the weather in a city.
        """
        return f"The weather in {city} is {self.config.weather}."

agent = WeatherAgent(WeatherConfig())
response = agent("What is the weather in Tokyo?")
print(response)
>>> The weather in Tokyo is sunny.
```
<Tip>
Config classes are not required, but they are recommended to store experiment specific parameters. This code is also correct
```python
class MyAgent(PrecompiledAgent):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)
        self.summarize = dspy.Predict(signature="question->answer")

    def forward(self, query: str) -> dspy.Prediction:
        return self.summarize(query=query)
```

# Push to Modaic Hub

You can push an agent to Modaic Hub with the `push_to_hub()` method. This will push your python modules, your prompts, and your config to Modaic's version controlled environment. Modaic Hub will also track any third party dependencies you use via pyproject.toml.

```python
agent.push_to_hub("your-username/my-agent")
```

You can also push the agent with code by passing in the `with_code` argument. This will push a packaged version of your agent to Modaic Hub, which can be loadedd externally via the AutoAgent class.

```python
agent.push_to_hub("your-username/my-agent", with_code=True)
```

<Warning>
  AutoAgent is still in development and only works with certain directory layouts.
</Warning>

# Load from Modaic Hub

You can load an agent from Modaic Hub with the `from_precompiled()` method. This will load the agent's prompts and config into your local environment.

To load the entire agent, including python modules and third party dependencies, see the [AutoAgent](/guides/agents/auto_agent) guide.

```python
agent = WeatherAgent.from_precompiled("your-username/my-agent")
```

You can also pass in any other arguments needed to load the agent in,

```python
agent = WeatherAgent.from_precompiled("your-username/my-agent", kwarg1=value1, kwarg2=value2)
```

# Add a Retriever to your Agent

You can configure your agent to work with a [retriever](/guides/retrievers/retrievers) by making it an arg in the agent's constructor. Retrivers are objects that retreive relevant context for your agent to use.

```python
from modaic import PrecompiledAgent, PrecompiledConfig, Retriever
import dspy

class WeatherConfig(PrecompiledConfig):
    weather: str = "sunny"

class WeatherRetriever(Retriever):
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(**kwargs)

    # all retrievers must implement the retrieve method
    def retrieve(self, query: str) -> str:
        """
        Get the weather in a city.
        """
        return f"The weather in {query} is {self.config.weather}."

class WeatherAgent(PrecompiledAgent):
    def __init__(self, config: WeatherConfig, retriever: Retriever, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(config, retriever=retriever, **kwargs) # !! This is super important you must pass the retiever in as as keyword argument to super().__init__()
        self.summarize = dspy.ReAct(signature="question->answer", tools=[self.retriever.retrieve])

    def forward(self, query: str) -> str:
        return self.summarize(query)
```
